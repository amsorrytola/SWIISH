# SWIISH 

SWIISH is an on-chain liquidity pool that lets users deposit two arbitrary tokens (Token A and Token B) into a constant-product AMM. Liquidity providers earn **iSWIISH** tokens as a reward. Traders can swap between Token A and Token B, paying a small HTR fee, and receive **uSWIISH** tokens for each swap. The contract also supports minting and claiming NFTs (two parallel DAO systems: Investor DAO & User DAO) based on SWIISH holdings. Finally, accumulated HTR fees can be distributed pro-rata to iSWIISH holders (minus a 5% owner fee).

## Key Features

1. **Dual-Token AMM**  
   - Users deposit Token A and Token B into the pool.  
   - Pricing follows a constant-product curve: x ¬∑ y = k.  

2. **Liquidity Rewards**  
   - When adding liquidity, providers receive **iSWIISH** tokens.  
   - The iSWIISH reward is higher if the deposited token is underrepresented in the pool.  

3. **Swap Functionality**  
   - Traders can swap between Token A and Token B.  
   - A small HTR fee (0.1% of input, minimum 1 HTR) is charged on each swap.  
   - Traders receive 1 **uSWIISH** token per successful swap.  

4. **NFT Tiers & DAO Governance**  
   - There are two NFT tracks:  
     - **Investor DAO NFTs** (five levels: enterDAO, experiencedMember, superMember, legendaryMember, ultimateMember)  
     - **User DAO NFTs** (five levels: enterDAO, experiencedMember, superMember, legendaryMember, ultimateMember)  
   - Eligibility depends on SWIISH holdings.  
   - Users may stake SWIISH or U-SWIISH into an NFT reserve, then ‚Äúclaim‚Äù an NFT on-chain when they meet the threshold.

5. **HTR Fee Distribution**  
   - 5% of collected HTR fees go to the pool owner.  
   - 95% of fees are distributed pro-rata to all iSWIISH holders.  
   - Only the owner or an Investor with ‚ÄúexperienceMember‚Äù NFT or higher may trigger distribution.  

6. **Withdrawal Mechanisms**  
   - **iSWIISH** and **uSWIISH** holders may withdraw their accrued balances.  
   - NFT-eligible users can claim exactly one NFT at a time.  
   - HTR distributions can be withdrawn by eligible addresses.

## Flow

1. **initialize(...)**  
   - Called once by the pool owner.  
   - Seeds SWIISH reserves with at least 1 000 iSWIISH and 1 000 uSWIISH.  
   - Sets Token A, Token B, NFT UIDs, and initializes all reserves and state maps.

2. **add_liquidity(...)**  
   - Liquidity provider deposits either Token A or Token B.  
   - They must withdraw the correct iSWIISH reward in the same transaction.  
   - The contract updates reserves and credits the user‚Äôs iSWIISH balance.

3. **add_swiish_liquidity(...)**  
   - Anyone can deposit additional iSWIISH or uSWIISH into the pool‚Äôs SWIISH reserve.  

4. **swap(...)**  
   - Trader deposits `token_in` and HTR fee, and withdraws `token_out` + 1 uSWIISH.  
   - The pool updates Token A & Token B reserves, collects the HTR fee, and rewards 1 uSWIISH.

5. **add_nft_liquidity(...)**  
   - Deposit any of the ten NFT UID tokens into the pool‚Äôs NFT reserve.  

6. **claim_nft(...)**  
   - User withdraws exactly 1 NFT if they meet the SWIISH holding threshold.  
   - The contract checks eligibility, burns one NFT from the reserve, and credits the user.

7. **distribute_htr(...)**  
   - Owner or Investor (‚â• ‚ÄúexperiencedMember‚Äù NFT) calls this to split the accumulated HTR fees.  
   - 5% goes to owner, and 95% is allocated pro-rata across all iSWIISH holders.  
   - Any rounding remainder remains in `htr_reserve`.

8. **withdraw_available_htr(...)**  
   - Any address with an HTR balance in `htr_withdrawable` can withdraw their full claim.
